# OvenTemp
A portable, battery powered temperature monitor for ovens that don't have temperature displays.


## Requirements

1. Refreshes temperature every second during cooking
2. Is easily readable from 10 feet away
3. Turns on automatically at 120 F
4. Has a battery life of a month of normal use
   - Normal use is four uses in a week with one hour of active oven time each
   - 16 hours active, ~656 hours idle
